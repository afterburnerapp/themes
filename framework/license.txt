Online Beta Trial License Agreement
By having clicked the "i agree" button and/or having downloading this software from the afterburner website, or if you have obtained this software by any other means, you agree to be bound by and become a party to this agreement. If you do not agree to all of the terms of this agreement, do not download, install, or use the software. Evaluation of the software is by permission of Hotware® LLC only, and only for applicants who accept this agreement, submit the information required and receive approval from the Hotware® LLC.  This online beta trial license agreement (this "Agreement") is an agreement between You ("Recipient") and Hotware® LLC ("Developer"), and sets forth the terms under which You may use the Afterburner Application development tool (the "Product") for a limited ninety (90) day evaluation period (the "Evaluation Period").
The Product contains valuable, confidential, trade secret information owned by Developer.
The Recipient desires to test and evaluate the Product's suitability for use in its business.
Therefore, in consideration of the promises set forth herein, the parties agree as follows:
1. Arrangement. Developer agrees to provide to the Recipient the Product, and Recipient accepts the Product, subject to the terms of this Agreement.  Recipient agrees to test and evaluate the Product as provided herein, report to Developer with respect to the usefulness and functionality of Product, and return the Product to Developer at the conclusion of the Beta Test, all pursuant to this Agreement.
2.    Non-Disclosure. A. Recipient acknowledges and agrees that in providing the Product, Developer may disclose to Recipient certain confidential, proprietary trade secret information of Developer (the "Confidential Information").  Confidential Information may include, but is not limited to, the Product, computer programs, flowcharts, diagrams, manuals, schematics, development tools, specifications, design documents, marketing information, financial information, and business plans.  During this Agreement and for a period of one year thereafter, Recipient agrees that it will not, without the express prior written consent of Developer, disclose any Confidential Information or any part thereof to any third party, except to the extent that such Confidential Information is or becomes generally available to the public through no fault of Recipient. At the termination of this Agreement, Recipient will return the Product and all other Confidential Information to Developer.  B.  Recipient also agrees that it shall not duplicate, translate, modify, copy, printout, disassemble, decompile, reverse engineer, or otherwise tamper with the Product or any software provided therewith.
3. License. Recipient acknowledges that Recipients shall have only a limited, non-exclusive, nontransferable license to use the Product for a period not to exceed 90 days.  Recipient acknowledges and agrees that it will not use the Product for any purpose that is illegal.  Because the Product is a "Beta Test" version only and is not error or bug free, Recipient agrees that it will use the Product carefully and will not use it in any way that might result in any loss of its or any third party's property or information.
4. Report. Recipient shall report to Developer, as soon as practical, any perceived defect in the Product and, following the discovery of any material defect, shall terminate its use of the Product.  At the conclusion of the Beta Test, Recipient shall provide to Developer an evaluation of the Product, including both positive and negative aspects.
5. Termination. Recipient may terminate this Agreement at any time prior to expiration of the Beta Test by returning the Product including all Confidential Information and copies thereof, to Developer, along with its evaluation report.  Developer may terminate this Agreement upon notice to Recipient, subject to Recipient's obligation to return the Product, Confidential Information and all copies thereof.  The obligations of Recipient in Section 2 above shall survive the termination of this Agreement.  If not earlier terminated, this Agreement shall terminate automatically upon the end of the period set forth in Section 3 and following Recipient's return of the Product and the Confidential Information.  Upon termination, Recipient agrees to remove from Recipient's computer any files related to the product.
6. Developer's Warranties. The proprietary code is provided "as is" without warranty of any kind, either express or implied, including the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, noninfringement, capacity, and title. The Developer does not warrant that the operation of the proprietary code will be uninterrupted or error-free or will meet all your needs. The Developer does not and cannot warrant the performance or results of using the proprietary code.  7. Notices. Any notice required by this Agreement or given in connection with it, shall be in writing and shall be given to the appropriate party by personal delivery or a recognized over night delivery service such as FedEx.
8. Indemnity. You agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Developer and its members, officers, agents, and employees, for all costs, expenses, and losses (including reasonable attorney's fees), arising from any and all claims arising out of or in connection with the use by You of the Proprietary Code.
9.  Entirety of Agreement. The terms and conditions set forth herein constitute the entire agreement between the parties and supersede any communications or previous agreements with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement.  There are no written or oral understandings directly or indirectly related to this Agreement that are not set forth herein.  No change can be made to this Agreement other than in writing and signed by both parties.
10.  Governing Law. This Agreement shall be construed and enforced according to the laws of the State of Oregon and any dispute under this Agreement must be brought in this venue and no other.
